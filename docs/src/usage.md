The ZenGui is a *menu*-driven GUI. It has four menu groups: *File*, *Edit*, *Style*, and *Help*.

## Change window's style

Please click the menus in *Style* one by one to see what happens.

## Seek helps

Please use the menu group *Help*. The ZenGui will invoke the default web browser of the OS to open the official documentation for the codes you are interested in.

## Edit configuration files

Please use the menu group *Edit*. For example, if we want to configure the *Zen* package, please click *Edit -> Integrated Package -> Zen*. Then ZenGui will popup a new window. It looks like as follows (see **Figure 2**):
