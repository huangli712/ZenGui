The ZenGui is a *menu*-driven GUI. It has four menu groups: *File*, *Edit*, *Style*, and *Help*.

## Change window's style

Please click the menus in *Style* one by one to see what happens.

## Seek helps

Please use the menu group *Help*. The ZenGui will invoke the default web browser of the OS to open the official documentation for the codes you are interested in.

## Edit configuration files

Please use the menu group *Edit*. For example, if we want to configure the *Zen* package, please click *Edit -> Integrated Package -> Zen*. Then ZenGui will popup a new window. It looks like as follows (see **Figure 2**):

At this window, we can setup the parameters for the *Zen* package easily. Be careful, there are five tabs in this window. They are related to the five blocks in the configuration file for the *Zen* package. So please click them one by one, and check whether all of the parameters are reasonable and valid. If you want to have a look at the configuration file, please click the *View* button at the bottom of this window. Then ZenGui will popup a new ``Preview'' window. It looks like as follows (See **Figure 3**):
