# ZenGui

ZenGui is the graphic user interface for the **Zen** DFT + DMFT computation framework. But now it is interfaced with the quantum impurity solvers (the **iQIST** code), analytic continuation tools (the **ACFlow** and **ACTest** codes), and dynamical mean-field theory engines (the **Dyson** and **DFermion** codes) as well.

This package is currently under heavy developement. **PLEASE USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!**
